# CipherOrDecipher

___
The _CipherOrDecipher_ program allows you 
**to encrypt** and **decrypt** the text 
entered by _the user_ using the selected 
encryption and decryption algorithm.
---
#### The program will include the following algorithms:

1. **_Atbash method_** - Encryption consists in replacing _**each letter**_ of the source text with **a symmetrical letter** of the alphabet;
2. **_Vigen√®re cipher_** - A method of _polyalphabetic_ encryption of literal text using **a keyword**;
3. **_Scrambling_** is an algorithm designed for **bit-by-bit** serial transmission of information that allows you to encrypt **_a digital_** stream;
4. **_Single permutation by key_** - a kind of **_symmetric encryption_** that allows plaintext to be presented in _a tabular version_ with **a rearrangement** of columns;
5. **_ADFGVX-cipher_** - a cipher that is _built_ on a combination of basic **_substitution and permutation_** operations;
6. **_Four square cipher_** - manual _symmetric_ encryption method that encrypts **_pairs_** of letters.
